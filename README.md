Insights:

Best-Selling Products: Certain item types, such as Office Supplies and Cereal, generate higher total revenues compared to others. Focusing on these high-performing categories can boost overall sales.

Profit Analysis: Despite some products having high sales volumes, their profit margins vary. Products like Personal Care and Household have better profit margins, suggesting that promotions for these items could be more beneficial.
